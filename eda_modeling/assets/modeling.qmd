Now we perform the data modeling using python and create an isolated environment with `venv`. The steps to follow are easy and it suffices to create the virtual environment using the terminal with the following command:

```         
python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

Then we can proceed to activate it using this command:

source *\<venv\>*/bin/activate where \<venv\> is the name of the virtual environment.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv("~/Desktop/Projects/DO4DS/eda_modeling/data/penguins.csv")
```

```{python}
model = LinearRegression()
x = df["bill_length_mm"]
y = df["body_mass_g"]
```

```{python}
model.fit(x.values.reshape(-1,1),y)
```

```{python}
y_pred = model.predict(x.values.reshape(-1,1))
```

```{python}
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
```

```{python}
r2_score(y, y_pred)
```

The $R^2$ score is pretty low suggesting that the model could be improved further by specifying some predictors or by adding the variation coming from the species.
