This is an example of an EDA carried out using R using an isolated environment created using `renv`

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggthemes)
```

```{r}
df <- penguins[complete.cases(penguins),]
head(df)
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_clean() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

This shows a direct positive correlation between the two variables and some differences across species.
